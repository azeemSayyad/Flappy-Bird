# Flappy Bird Game using Pygame

![Flappy Bird Gameplay](gameplay.gif)

## Description

Flappy Bird is a classic 2D side-scrolling game where the player controls a bird's flight through a series of pipes. The goal is to navigate the bird through the gaps between the pipes without colliding with them. The bird automatically descends due to gravity, and the player can make it flap by pressing a key, causing it to momentarily fly upward.

## Features

- Simple and intuitive controls: Press a key to make the bird flap and navigate through the pipes.
- Physics-based flight: Implement realistic bird flight using physics calculations for gravity, velocity, and acceleration.
- Continuous rendering: Utilize Pygame's rendering capabilities to create a seamless and dynamic game environment.
- Image processing: Handle sprite animations and collision detection using image processing techniques.

## Physics Calculations

The game's physics engine involves the following key calculations:

- **Gravity**: The bird experiences a constant downward force that accelerates it. This is integrated over time to adjust the bird's velocity.
- **Velocity and Position**: The bird's vertical velocity is used to update its position on each frame. The velocity is adjusted by gravity and the player's input.
- **Jump/Fly**: When the player presses the jump key, the bird's velocity is set to counteract gravity, giving it an upward boost.

## Image Processing and Rendering

- **Sprites**: The game utilizes sprite sheets for animations, including the bird's flapping wings and the pipe obstacles.
- **Rendering Loop**: Pygame's rendering loop continuously updates and redraws the game elements, creating the illusion of movement.
- **Collision Detection**: Collision between the bird and pipes is detected using bounding boxes around their sprite images.

## How to Play

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/flappy-bird-game.git`
2. Install Pygame: `pip install pygame`
3. Run the game: `python flappy_bird.py`
4. Use the designated key to control the bird's flight and navigate through the pipes.

## Acknowledgments

This game was created as a personal project to learn game development concepts and improve programming skills. It is inspired by the original Flappy Bird game developed by Dong Nguyen.
